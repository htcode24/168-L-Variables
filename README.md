# 168-L-Variables
I created a simple website by adding a JS file, CSS file, and connected them to my HTML file. My main priority was demonstrating how to create variables using let and const in my JS file. My variables consisted of strings, numbers, and boolean. I used ID to display the values of the variables in the browser. 

When creating my variables, I focused on the subject Bubble Milk Tea.
Here are the variables I created using const:
tea, typeOfDrink, toppings, toppingsCost, iceLevel, sugarLevel, sugarLevel, drinkSize, drinkSizeCost

I created the variable tea using const and assigned it an array of strings with tea names.
I created the variable toppings using const and assigned it an array of strings with topping names.
I created the variable drinkSizeCost using const and assigned it an array of numbers.

To display the description of my regular drink order, I created the variable myRegularOrder using let, called the assignment operator = to reference the arrays from drinkSize, tea, typeOfDrink, toppings, iceLevel, and sugarLevel
To display and calculate the cost of my regular drink order, I created the variable myRegularOrderCost using let, called the assignment operator = to reference drinkSizeCost to add it to toppingsCost listed twice using the addition operator +.
